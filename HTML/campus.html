                <article>
                    Studying as an international student can be an exciting and 
                    challenging experience. It involves 
                    leaving your home country and immersing yourself in a new culture, meeting new people, 
                    and navigating a different education system.

                    As an international student, you will have the opportunity to gain 
                    valuable knowledge and skills, broaden your perspective, and build your 
                    personal and professional network. However, there may also be unique challenges 
                    such as language barriers, cultural differences, and adapting to a new way of life. 
                    Nonetheless, Rosebank is here to guide you by creating a rewarding experience 
                    that can pave the way for future success
